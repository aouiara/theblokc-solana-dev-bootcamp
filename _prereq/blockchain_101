HOW BLOCKCHAIN WORKS

* A transaction is needed to be requested
* A block is then created from the transaction
* All node in the network receives the block
* The nodes validate the transaction
  - where mining happens
  - they find solutions to the puzzle
  - validation happens
  - problem solving
* Validation is needed for nodes to receive a reward for the proof of work
* Block is added to the existing blockchain
  - this process repeats
* Transaction complete


- BLOCKCHAIN IS IMUTABLE (cannot edit blocks)

- Chaining happens when the second block carries the hash of the previous block (simply just like the chain)

- Changes in the previous block is REJECTED since the current block carries the previous (unchanged) hash of the previous block therefore, changes are evitable.

- Uses gas as transaction fees
